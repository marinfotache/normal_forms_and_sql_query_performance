# Database Normal Forms and SQL Query Performance

## Goal
In this study, the effects of database normalization (first three normanl forms, i.e. 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF) on the TPC-H database were tested for MS-SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. 

## Research Design


## Results
Results raise serious concerns about the conventional consensus on the performance gains incurred by the reduced number of table joins. 
Even for small-sized databases, the penalties due to the extra volume caused by redundancy associated with lower normal forms
seem larger than the performance gains due to the reduced number of joins.
